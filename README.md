This repository contains the Sphero component for OpenHPS (Open Source Hybrid Positioning System). 

OpenHPS is a data processing positioning framework. It is designed to support many different use cases ranging from simple positioning such as detecting the position of a pawn on a chessboard using RFID, to indoor positioning methods using multiple cameras.

## Getting Started
If you have [npm installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), start using @openhps/sphero with the following command.
```bash
npm install @openhps/sphero --save
```

## Contributors
The framework is open source and is mainly developed by PhD Student Maxim Van de Wynckel as part of his research towards *Hybrid Positioning and Implicit Human-Computer Interaction* under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Beat Signer.

## Contributing
Use of OpenHPS, contributions and feedback is highly appreciated. Please read our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
